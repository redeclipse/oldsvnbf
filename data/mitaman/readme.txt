Textures by Michael A. "MitaMAN" Poeschl (mitaman1@optonline.net)

All texture files contained within this "mitaman" folder are for exclusive use in the game BLOOD FRONTIER. All MitaMan textures begin with the prefix "mm-***.jpg" and can be identified as such.
Redistribution, modification, or repacking of the textures outside the context of the game BLOOD FRONTIER is strictly prohibited.
Modification of texture files contained within this "mitaman" folder is permitted, but must remain within the context of the game BLOOD FRONTIER.

CG Textures (http://www.cgtextures.com) was the main source of raw texture material used to make these textures for BLOOD FRONTIER.
CG Textures has a strict texture (raw or modified) redistribution policy, you have been warned.

None of the raw textures were "just copied and renamed". All were modified / tiled / layered / enhanced / pieced together by me (MitaMAN) using Photoshop version 7. Normal maps were made using the free nVidia plug-in for Photoshop. Specular maps were made by using brightness and contrast filters within Photoshop.

ENJOY BLOOD FRONTIER: IT'S BLOODY FUN!
