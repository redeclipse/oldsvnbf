<h2 id="gameplay_scripting">Gameplay Scripting</h2>

<p>
The RPG is set up in a very open way such that all gameplay objects and behaviour can be modified in a script file,
currently in data/game_rpg.cfg (this will change later to be on a per-map basis). The idea is that every map comes with its own "mod",
and that gameplay can be influenced by level designer, allowing gameplay types spanning
from a stat/story influenced FPS game, an action RPG, all the way to more complex
quest/story/stat based RPGs.
</p>

<p>
This file simply lists all gameplay objects, which can then be placed in the level editor. For example, by writing:
</p>

<pre id="spawn_apple">spawn_apple = [ r_worth 20 ]</pre>

<p>
you define a script that gets executed when an apple is spawned. You place this apple either directly in the world or as part of another objects inventory.
To place it in the world, you create an entity of type "spawn" with a name attached. This is best done by typing (in the console):
</p>

<pre id="newrpgspawn">newrpgspawn apple</pre>

<p>
which will show you your new entity in the editor. Running the map then will create
a new apple object at that location, with all stats set to your liking (in this
case just its worth).</p>
<p>
What is important to realize is that most r_ commands work with what is called the RPG stack. This makes it possible to apply
properties and actions to things without having to specify all the time which object you are talking about. For example, when the
spawn_apple script gets executed, the apple object will be on the top of the RPG stack, so any commands such as r_worth that apply to an
object, will automatically apply to it. It is a stack, because during the initialization of one object you may spawn another, which means
all r_ commands will apply to the new object, until it is done, when the RPG stack returns to the previous object.
</p>

<p>
Following is a list of all commands... unless otherwise noted, they apply to the current object (top of the RPG stack).
</p>

<h2 id="rpg_object_commands">RPG object commands</h2>


<pre id="r_pop">r_pop</pre>
<p>
Removes the top object from the RPG stack
</p>

<pre id="r_spawn">r_spawn N</pre>
<p>
creates a new object, places it on the top of the RPG stack, then executes spawn_N to initialize it.
</p>

<pre id="r_contain">r_contain T</pre>
<p>
Takes the object on the top of the stack, and makes it part of the inventory of the object on the stack below it.
T is the type of inventory object, see the convenient scripts r_inventory, r_loot, r_fortrade instead.
</p>

<pre id="r_model">r_model M</pre>
<p>
Specify model M to represent this object visually when placed in the world
</p>

<pre id="r_ai">r_ai</pre>
<p>
Signifies that this object should run AI code when placed in the world, used for NPCs/monsters, not items.
</p>

<pre id="r_action">r_action N A</pre>
<p>
defines a custom action the player can take on this object. N is the tag word that describes the action, visible in
the objects menu in the game world, and A is the script that gets executed when the player selects it.
</p>

<pre id="r_say">r_say T</pre>
<p>
Make text T the last thing this object said to the player
</p>

<pre id="r_take">r_take N A NA</pre>
<p>
Attempt to take object with name N from the player inventory, and place it in the objects inventory. If the item was succesfully grabbed (it was present),
action A is executed. If the item was not available, NA is executed. r_take is the preferred way to structure resolution of quests, i.e. everything the player ever
needs to do should go via token items.
</p>

<pre id="r_give">r_give N</pre>
<p>
give the player an item with name N
</p>



<h2 id="H2_1">RPG stats &amp; attributes</h2>
<p>
The following is a list of all stats tracked by each object. A stat is defined as a property of an object that determines its effectiveness when performing a certain action,
i.e. the "melee" stat affects your melee combat effectiveness. Stats are things that you can build up thruout the game, hence "health" is not a stat, but it is dependent on a stat, maxhp.

</table>
<p>
a stat can be set on any rpg object using the r_X command, where X is any of the
above stat names, e.g. <i>r_melee 50</i>
gives the current object 50 melee points.
a script can read the current points using r_get_X, i.e. <i>echo "your melee points are: " (r_get_melee)</i>
outputs the current objects melee points.
</p>
<p>
A special case are objects that have no stats set directly (typically the player,
and sometimes NPCs): their stats are computed as cumulative from the stats of all
their inventory items. So if the player carries a gem that has melee 50, and gloves
that have melee 20, his own melee points are 70.
</p>
<p>
It's important to realize that stat points do not directly translate to damage and
such. Points are an indication of efficiency of a particular stat over the base
100%, along a logarithmic curve. So 0 melee points translates into 100% melee efficiency,
and what 70 melee points translates into... well, something above 100%, depending
on the log curve. Every map can define their own log curve for each stat, depending
on how fast you want points to result in increased melee damage. This is a game
balancing thing, in the sense that if the game world makes obtain items with melee
points too easy and the log curve is too gentle, then players will be overpowered.
The formula for melee is (other stats work similarly):
</p>
<p>
<i>meleedamage = weapondamage * ( log ( points / pointsscale + 1 ) * percentscale + 100 ) / 100</i>
</p>
<p>
(log = natural logarithm). so with a pointscale of 10, and a percentscale of 25,
our 70 points amount to a 152% melee efficiency, which, when combined with a weapon
that does 10 damage (at 100%), now does 15 melee damage. For movespeed you'd have
a similar formula, where instead of weapondamage you'd have the default running
speed.
</p>
<p>
That may seem like a really convoluted way of doing things, but the log scale is
the only way to give a relatively constant challenge level in the game. Without
it, the game would start hard and become too easy real soon. The UI will show both
points and efficiency for stats so you can easy see the effect without understanding
the math.
</p>
<p>
You can define the log scale by doing: <i>r_def_X pointscale percentscale</i>, but this should only
really ever be done by the game designer, or experienced rpg level designers on their own levels, as tweaking
these values requires deep insight into how players will collect points thruout
a game.
</p>
<p>
It is worth repeating what should be obvious from the above: the player and npcs
don't have "levels" as in other RPGs. Increased ability is purely denoted by means
of points and efficiency above whatever is the 100% value of the related ability.
The end result is similar to traditional RPGs, but not quite. The above system is
more flexible in the sense that you can have completely independent "levels" for
all your abilities. But best of all, since your points are determined by what you
have in your inventory, any way you can get items can increase your ability, which
includes killing, stealing, finding, trading etc. You can change how you assign
your priorities mid-game, by trading melee items for magic items, for example. You
won't hit a "item plateau" as in so many RPG games 20% into the game because most
items you get are useless, here you can put everything to <em>some</em> use, even
if sometimes minimal.
</p>

The following are the attributes of any rpg object. Attrs are simpler in the sense
that they are just variables kept track of per object, and can be set/changed by
either the rpg system or the script code. They are all default 0 for a newly
initialized object.
